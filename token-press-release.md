## Update Feb 16th on Allocation/Market Cap/Vesting Press Release
(bankr.bot)[bankr.bot) founder (@0xDeployer)[x.com/0xDeployer) graciously agreed to redirect fees from (bankr.bot)[bankr.bot] to singularity-engine to help us fund our grand vision: (press release)[https://x.com/metatransformr/status/2023205497499680838]
He'sa really great guy.
(press release)[https://x.com/metatransformr/status/2023205497499680838])


```
token: singularity-engine (0x06cece127f81bf76d388859549a93a120ec52ba3)
your balance: 10,859,288,916.5 tokens ($96,261.94)

this is a bankr-deployed token with 1,336 holders and a market cap of $873,932.```
```
## Disclosure 
More about the launch later. on to tokens.
## What Happened

I built [Singularity Engine](https://github.com/Metatransformer/singularity-engine) — an open-source, autonomous tweet-to-app pipeline. it's MIT-licensed. anyone can fork it.

within minutes of posting about it on X, users created tokens around it and pressured me to claim fees. not fully understanding the mechanics, i tweeted at bankr.bot and it deployed a token on the BASE network tied to my X account.

- **Token contract:** [`0x06CecE127F81Bf76d388859549A93a120Ec52BA3`](https://dexscreener.com/base/0x06CecE127F81Bf76d388859549A93a120Ec52BA3)  
- **My wallet:** [`0xa16e917b674D0af28b0952245653f3d988D83D50`](https://basescan.org/address/0xa16e917b674D0af28b0952245653f3d988D83D50)

i sold all my crypto in 2022. this was my first time touching defi. i made mistakes from ignorance, not malice.

## What I Originally Thought vs. What's Actually On-Chain

I initially believed I held ~57% of the token supply with no vesting. **That was wrong.**

An independent on-chain analysis (by [@austingriffith](https://x.com/austingriffith), Ethereum Foundation) revealed:

| What I Thought | What's Actually On-Chain |
|---|---|
| 57% of supply in my wallet | **0 tokens** in my wallets |
| Massive creator allocation | All 100B tokens went directly to Uniswap V4 LP at deployment |
| I earned tokens from fees | I earned **WETH only** from trading fees (~3.54 WETH / ~$8,015) |
| Bankr gave me 57% of supply | Bankr's deployment sent everything to LP atomically in one transaction |

**The actual buyback** Dialogue

**Before Buy-Back, 9:55 PM CST**
```➜  singularity-token-final git:(main) ✗ bankr prompt "do i own the wallet 0xfc16...7f38 4,602,770,033   4.60%   Contract       Privy wallet — likely dev buy at launch for singularity-engine how many tokens are owned at this time 955 pm"

Job ID:  job_SAJVDMRRMVJR2LX9
Thread ID:  thr_3Z3X6CZ7MF2R3EBY

✔ Completed in 53.9s (job_SAJVDMRRMVJR2LX9)

yes, you own the wallet 0xfc16a0abf29fd51e6523d48eb884c81ee1547f38.

as of now, you hold 4,602,770,033.21 singularity-engine tokens in that wallet on base.

this represents approximately 4.60% of the total supply, as you noted. the token is currently trading at $0.00000281 with a market cap of $281,299.47.
```

**Checking How Much I can Buy (9:58PM)**
```
➜  singularity-token-final git:(main) ✗ bankr prompt "how much singularity-engine token can i purchase right now with m
y trading wallet"
✔ Prompt submitted
Job ID:  job_MD8ANAE5P7QFQQM8
Thread ID:  thr_JXE64TWWZXDHNMM7

✔ Completed in 55.6s (job_MD8ANAE5P7QFQQM8)

you can purchase approximately 2,589,912,296 singularity-engine tokens with your current trading wallet balance.

your total portfolio value is $7,289.17, primarily held in 3.54 WETH on Base.

singularity-engine is currently trading at $0.000002814 on Base.

singularity-engine: $0.000002814 (+118.55% 24h)
total balance: $7,289.17
max purchase: ~2.59B tokens

note that this doesn't account for slippage or liquidity depth, which would likely impact the final amount on a trade of this size relative to the $174k liquidity.```

**POST LAUNCH CLARIFICATION ON FURTHER TOKENS FOR MESH/SINGULARITY ENGINE, 3 AM CST Tuesday 17 Feb**

```
I launched with my friends for final tests exactly at 11:30 PM Midnight as promised (pre-launch tweet + working builds happening starting at 11:30)[https://x.com/metatransformr/status/2023624722022277382?s=20]

As it was in a working state, I didn't make another statement until 1:15 AM (lost track of time):
(Post launch statement coming soon)[https://x.com/metatransformr/status/2023657576412438574?s=2] in the following way:

Apparently they didn't see the actual working engine on the previous thread, and it was my mistake to not have the post ready at midnight but I didn't want to post until I was sure it would work.

Some lovely shitcoiners responded:
- Why another token ?
- So you're releasing new tokens?
- bro wants the token at 0 before any real updates happen I guess
- post launch? did I miss the actual launch post? i’m lost haha
- gay dev farming
- stop dumping scam

Around this time everyone was freaking out yada yada and I was editing my (actual launch post)[https://x.com/metatransformr/status/2023676262871449764?s=20] which I felt was ready at for public testing at 2:29 AM.

At this time some real builds started working, but I found more holes in the stack and immediately set to patching them (backlog got clogged.)

Finally responded with this statement that I stand by as I am committing it to the repo:

I was working out kinks post-launch for the past 2 hours because im an actual dev and it's 3 AM again.

So let me make this ABUNDANTLY CLEAR:

I am not launching ANY NEW TOKENS FOR THESE PROJECTS.

$singularity-engine on BASE is the *only* token that is being launched for singularity engine AND the Mesh.

0x06CecE127F81Bf76d388859549A93a120Ec52BA3

In 2 minutes this will be BOUND and version controlled in my TOKENOMICS PRESS RELEASE i created before

It's now 3 AM so I'm a bit late but here it is. Bound to the repo.

In other news, bankr.bot aka 0xDeployer did agree to help me bring up the treasury of the project (resulting in another press release a while back on updated tokenomics, also stored in this repo)
and as of now (despite the panic dumping around midnight) - the treasury allocation is :
singularity-engine - 10,859,288,916.504516446965549128 ($105,896.42) - about 10.859% of a pool of 100B tokens (that 100B will never change.)

market cap is $986.0k.

full breakdown:

singularity-engine on base
- price: $0.00000986
- market cap: $986.0k
- 24h volume: $1.0m
- 24h change: -26.20%

## What I Did With the Fees

When I learned fees were claimable, I was advised to convert them to WETH. I did. I now understand this was premature — I should have waited until I understood the full picture.

**What I'm doing about it:** I am using the 3.54 WETH to buy back into the token at market price, creating a transparent "founder allocation" that I earned and then reinvested. This buy will be executed on-chain and the transaction hash will be added to this document.

---

## Who I've Talked To

Before publishing this, I consulted:

- **[@0xDeployer](https://x.com/0xDeployer)** (creator of bankr.bot) — advised against burning, is building a vesting/transparent-selling platform for exactly this situation
- **[@austingriffith](https://x.com/austingriffith)** (Ethereum Foundation) — conducted the on-chain analysis, suggested LP+vesting smart contract approach where locked tokens also provide liquidity
- **[@nateliason](https://x.com/nateliason)** — went through the same situation, confirmed the direction is right

---

## My Commitments

### 1. No Token Sales Until Structure Exists

I will not sell any tokens until:
- A proper vesting/lockup structure is in place (using 0xDeployer's platform or Austin's LP+vesting approach - 0xDeployer has assured me that https://bankr.bot/ is working on a vesting solution for project owners)
- The project has been live for at least 90 days
- At least 50 unique users have triggered builds
- A community has formed, expressing interested in growing this (and possibly related projects)

### 2. Buyback Transparency

I am converting my earned WETH back into the token at market price. The transaction hash will be posted here when executed. This creates a verifiable founder position that I paid for at the same price as everyone else.

### 3. Fee Income → Project Treasury

All future trading fee income will flow to a dedicated, public treasury wallet — not my personal wallet. Every transaction visible on-chain. Monthly summaries published.

**Temporary Treasury Wallet (BASE):** [`0xfc16a0abf29fd51e6523d48eb884c81ee1547f38`](https://basescan.org/address/0xfc16a0abf29fd51e6523d48eb884c81ee1547f38)

The treasury uses WETH and Base ETH to purchase into the treasury. As of this update, the treasury is sitting at approximately **10–11%** of total supply, with a goal of reaching **15–25%**.

### 4. Tokenomics: Punt With Intent

I'm being honest: **I don't have a final tokenomics plan yet.** The experts I'm working with (0xDeployer, Austin Griffith) are building better tools than what exists today. Rather than rush a half-baked plan, I'm committing to:

- Work with these advisors over the coming weeks
- Publish the final tokenomics structure within 30 days (by March 16, 2026)
- The structure will include vesting, lockups, and contributor frameworks
- All actions will be on-chain and verifiable
- **If I fail to deliver this within 30 days, treat this document as worthless**

### 5. Zero Personal Profit Until Milestones

No fee income or token value converted to personal income until:
- [ ] Token lockup/vesting structure deployed on-chain
- [ ] Singularity Engine live and functioning for 90+ days  
- [ ] 50+ unique users have triggered builds
- [ ] Public treasury wallet established
- [ ] Operating agreement published

Until then, fees are earmarked for infrastructure only (AWS, API keys, domains).

### 6. If It Doesn't Work Out

If the project fails to meet expectations listed on section (1) or the token dies due to circumstances out of my control:
- Final treasury report published
- Remaining fees not converted to personal income
- All code stays MIT-licensed
- Public shutdown notice posted

**The project was never supposed to depend on the token. If the token dies, the software continues.**

## Disclosure on Launch Expectations and Goals

The product is *not in a launched state yet* as I am still working on a few core pieces:
- Ensuring the dynnamoDB integration and vibe coding produce worthwhile outputs through testing (I do like the snake and tron games I made though as a start. But there have been bugs with the data layer of some of these early tests)
- Thinking about whether authentication or complex apps are part of what we're trying to do here (I Don't think the answer is yes immediately for the launch, but it could be roadmapped.)

The launch will be a Tweet -> NoSQL backed single page JS app pipeline for tweeting an idea into reality. Think games, productivity apps, cool bot tools, anything that runs in the browser. visualizations. Whatever. Doesnt just have to use X, could use any channel. I want it to be fun and I want it to be sci fi. I want to take part in what's happening right now. 

I'm using a transparent AWS stack for this repo and the bot will be hooked up to my X, and it will be allowing people to do up to 2 builds per day using mine, or install the software open source with the CLI to set it up on AWS themselves. 

If X TOS/API/rate limit issues burn the possibility of this thing working over the expenses it incurs, I'm willing to front $10k of my own money for the launch, but after that I'm not willing to continue pumping money into something if it's unprofitable. It was supposed to be a demo. I digress.


## Long Horizon Vision (If It Earns the Right to Exist)

If the token develops real utility, I want to build a self-sustaining open-source ecosystem where crypto funds infrastructure, pays contributors, and removes the need for VC funding. Projects in the roadmap:

- **Singularity Engine** — the tweet-to-app pipeline (prelaunch)
- **Life OS** — personal operating system for health, finances, relationships (in development)
- **The Mesh** — encrypted P2P relay + 3D metaverse for human-AI collaboration (in development)
- **Many More Ideas** - I am full of them. We are moving fast these days.

But visions mean nothing without proof of work. Right now I have a vision and some trading fees. This document is step one of earning trust.
