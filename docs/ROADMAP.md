## 🟢 Now (Active)

What we're building right now.

- [ ] **Better builds** — improve code generation quality, fewer broken deploys
- [ ] **Faster deploys** — reduce end-to-end build time (target: <20s)
- [ ] **Smarter iteration** — tell the bot to improve an existing build ("make the colors darker", "add a leaderboard")
- [ ] **API-driven apps** — real backends, not just static HTML/JS/CSS. Per-app API endpoints.
- [ ] **Improved error handling** — structured errors, user-friendly failure messages
- [ ] **@SingularityEngn bot** — dedicated bot account for build requests (DMs + mentions)

## 🔵 Next

On deck after current priorities.

- [ ] **Beyond X** — work everywhere, not just Twitter. Multi-channel input: Telegram, Discord, OpenClaw, Mesh
- [ ] **Private repos** — take your builds home, private source code + hosting
- [ ] **Environment variables** — secrets and API keys for private projects
- [ ] **Per-app API keys** — DynamoDB namespace auth, prevent cross-app data access
- [ ] **Dashboard MVP** — view your builds, source code, build logs

## 🟣 Later

Bigger bets, longer horizon.

- [ ] **Dashboard with analytics** — traffic, usage stats, build history, cost tracking
- [ ] **Pay-for-more-builds** — Stripe integration, default free tier + paid plans
- [ ] **Multi-user auth per app** — session-based authentication, let apps have their own users
- [ ] **Kubernetes portability** — Helm chart, run Singularity Engine anywhere (not just AWS)
- [ ] **Multiple programming languages** — Python, Go, beyond HTML/JS/CSS
- [ ] **CloudFront CDN** — custom domains, faster global loads
