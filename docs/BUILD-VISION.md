# The Open Mesh Build Vision & Product Architecture

Saved from Nick's synthesis document (Feb 18, 2026).
See ~/Documents/update-metax.txt for the X thread version.

## Key Decisions from this Document:
1. Bot OS is NOT a separate product — it's just a mesh node at org scale
2. Three-layer stack: Singularity Engine → The Mesh → $singularity-engine token
3. Grok as model backend (X-native builds)
4. Build iteration (reply to improve existing builds) = #1 priority
5. DID provenance on every build artifact
6. On-chain build receipts on BASE (first token utility)
7. Mesh Node SDK = extracted PE Fund AI OS patterns
8. npx create-mesh-node as the CLI

## Timeline:
- Now → Week 2: SE v1.0 (Grok, iteration, DID provenance)
- Weeks 3-4: Mesh Node SDK v0.1
- Weeks 5-8: Federation (UCAN, A2A, libp2p)
- Weeks 9-12: Token integration (on-chain attestation)
- Weeks 13-24: Spatial layer + community
